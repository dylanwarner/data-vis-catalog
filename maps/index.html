                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Map visualizations are used to show data based on geography of countries. The chart above
                       visualizes the United States with points placed at major cities based on population. Hovering over
                       a point shows the name and population of the city. Map visualizations are useful for any kind of data related
                       to geography.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Map visualizations use lines, areas, and points as marks. Points are represeted by the red data points placed
                       at the major U.S. cities and serve as interaction points for data. Lines and areas are used to create the United States
                       geography. The main channels used here are shape, positioning, and color. Shape is used to represent the shapes of the states. Positioning 
                       is used to place the various points at the latitudes and longitudes of the cities in the dataset. Color is used on the data points to make
                       them stand out.
