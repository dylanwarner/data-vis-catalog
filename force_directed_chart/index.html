                    <p>A force directed graph consists of edges and nodes that are assigned forces based on their
                       positions. Those forces are then used to simulate force and motion.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>A force directed graph uses lines and points as marks. The lines are used for the edges that connect the nodes to each other and the
                       nodes are represented by the points(circles). Color can be used as a channel to group nodes into 
                       categories.</p>
