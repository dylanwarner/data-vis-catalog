                    <p>A chord diagram is a circular graph which uses data from a matrix to show
                       relationships. The data for a chord diagram is drawn around the chart radially with arcs
                       connecting the data.</p>

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Chord diagrams use lines and areas as marks. The areas are drawn as arcs around the chart, connecting 
                       the different data points. Color can be used as a channel to color the arcs to represent different datasets.
