                    <p>Line charts use a series of data points connected by lines to display information.
                       Line graphs are useful for showing changes in data over time. </p>

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The marks used in line charts are most commonly lines. Line charts can also use points to 
                       distinguish data points. Line length and tilt are used to represent data as well as reveal
                       trends. Color can be used if multiple lines are present to distinguish between datasets.
