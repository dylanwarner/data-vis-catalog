                    <p>Treemaps are another type of hierarchical chart that consist of nested rectangles. 
                       The branches of the trees are represented by rectangles, with their children shown as 
                       smaller tiled rectangles. Treemaps are useful for showing hierarchical data, or data with
                       groupings.

                    <p>Treemaps use areas as the marks. The areas are represented as nested rectangles. Each nested
                       rectangle represents a branch on the tree. Color can be used as a channel to show depth between 
                       the layers of the treemap. Size of the rectangles is used to show which values are larger.
