                    <p>A tree diagram is a type of hierarchical chart consisting of nodes and branches.
                       Tree diagrams show connections or relationships through the use of nodes connected
                       by branches. They are most useful for visualizing hierarchical data, typically used
                       to show family relations.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Tree diagrams use points, lines, and connections (nodes and branches) as marks.
                       These marks help to create a sense of hierarchy and form connections between data.
                       Color can be used as a channel to group nodes or represent depth.
