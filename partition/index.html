                    <p>Partition diagrams are another type of hierarchy chart similar to a treemap. Partitions are different in that 
                       they are adjacency diagrams. Nodes are either represented by arcs or rectangles and are drawn next to other nodes based
                       on relations. Partitions are useful for hierarchical data or data that involves groupings.

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Partition diagrams use areas as marks. These areas are represented by either rectangles or arcs placed adjacent to one another.
                       Size is used as a channel to represent a flow or hierarchy of information. The root parent at the top is the largest with a continual 
                       decrease in size as you move down layers of the chart. Color is another channel that can be used to group nodes or show depth.
