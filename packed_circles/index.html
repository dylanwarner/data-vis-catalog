                    <p>A packed circle chart is a type of hierarchical chart that involves groupings of circles.
                       It is similar to a treemap in that each branch of a tree is represented by a circle with the 
                       children shown as circles inside it. Packed circle charts are useful for visualizing hierarchical data
                       and large datasets. </p>

                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Packed circle charts use areas as marks. Color and size are important channels for packed circle charts.
                       Circle size can be used to show hierarchies and groupings as well as specific values. Color can be used to
                       show groupings or reinforce the hierarchy through depth. </p>
